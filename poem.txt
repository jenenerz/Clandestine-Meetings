Clandestine Meetings

An emotional affair
How can you be so unfair?
All you do is let me down
I see you all over town

You left your phone in my room
You linger like bad perfume
I remember 11th of June
Said you would be here by noon

Lost it for a minute there
But I remember the name blair
The stolen glances, quiet lies,
A love that lived in alibis
